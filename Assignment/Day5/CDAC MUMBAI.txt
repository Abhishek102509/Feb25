Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is 
any need to insert some data then do that as well. 
//========================================================


a) Navigate and List:
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a 
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it. 


Ans............
if [-d "LinuxAssignment"]; then
mkdir LinuxAssignment
cd LinuxAssignment



b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its 
contents. ==============
Ans........
touch file1.txt
cat file1.txt
===================
c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.

Ans.....
mkdir docs


d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt". 
...........
Ans........... 
cp file1.txt docs/file2.txt

e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for 
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to 
the current user. 

Ans.......
chmode 644 docs/file2.txt
chown $(whoami): (whoami) docs/file2.txt

Ans...
ping -c 4 "remote_server_address" like google.com

j) File Compression:
a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file
An............
zip -r docs.zip docs

Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is 
any need to insert some data then do that as well. 


a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command. 

Ans...........
head -n 10 data.txt


b. Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of "data.txt" using another command.

Ans...........
tail -n 5 data.txt
 
c. In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of 
this file to analyze the initial data set.

Ans...........
head -n 15 numbers.txt

 
d. To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt".

Ans...........
tail -n 3 numbers.txt
 
e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file 
named "output.txt."

Ans...................
tr 'a-x' 'A-Z' <input.txt> output.txt
 
f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are 
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt." 


g. In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a 
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in 
"fruit.txt." 
Ans...........
sort fruit.txt | uniq -c
