   if any element is same for every page then still browser will load it again and again



React JS: is a library to develop frontend of a web application
developed by Facebook
Using React js we develop a single page application

SPA: will have only 1 html file 
index.html
navbar
home content
footer

about-us
gallery

instead of creating different html files, here in react js we have to create components
component: ui element 


react app: folder structure and file structure
	   package.json
            index.js
	  required dependencies
          boilerplate code


cli tool -> create-react-app, vite

npm create vite@latest

in every react application, one predefined component is always there i.e. App component

Navbar.js or .jsx
Footer.js
Home.js

main.jsx -> rendering -> App.jsx

two types of components:
1. class based component: to represent a component if class has been created 

create a own class, inherit Component class that is predefined in react module, then only your own class will be treated as react component

 MyComponent -> <MyComponent></MyComponent>
 LoginForm -> <LoginForm></LoginForm>

2. function based component :to represent a component if we are creating a function
function component is always a lightweight component
